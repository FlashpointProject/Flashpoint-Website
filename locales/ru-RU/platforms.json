  "Platforms_3D_Groove_GX_Description": "Основанный в 1998 году, The Groove Alliance был разработчиком 3D Groove SX, движка 3D на базе Shockwave. Позднее в 2002 году движок отделился от Shockwave и стал самостоятельным, переименовавшись в 3D Groove GX. Оба варианта могут быть использованы для разработки онлайн-игр и настольных приложений. Этот шаг оказался успешным для компании из-за увеличивающегося количества корпоративных пользователей, приводя к созданию громких тайтлов для телевизионных шоу и многих других секторов. После спадения популярности, The Groove Alliance паз был преобразован в OTOY в 2008 году, но сайт 3D Groove остался открытым до 2009. Точная причина упразднения компании не установлена, но было потверждено, что внутренний конфликт сыграл свою роль.",

  "Platforms_Adobe_Flash_Player_Description": "Adobe Flash Player (также просто Flash, ранее Macromedia Shockwave Flash Player) - это плеер для векторной анимации и графики, часто с добавленной интерактивностью. Он использовался в качестве средства для веб-игр благодаря его эффективному сжатию, низкой цене, простоте в использовании и большой базе установок. Разработанная в 1995 и впервые представленная FutureWave в 1996 году, она изначально не отличалась каким-либо большим функционалом. По мере увеличения популярности добавлялись более продвинутые возможности для проигрывателя, такие как язык программирования ActionScript. Однако, по мере того как люди стали опасаться возможных проблем с безопасностью, и HTML5 набирал популярность среди веб-разработчиков, Adobe анонсировала дату окончания поддержки Flash 31 декабря 2020 года.",

Основанная на технологиях, которые были разработаны 10 лет назад MacroMind, она стала веб-плагином только после его приобретения Macromedia. В отличие от Flash, Shockwave предоставляла язык программирования Lingo и поддержку C++ с помощью Xtras, давая проигрывателю широкий спектр возможностей, в том числе поддержку 3D. Он широко использовался как в раннем интернете, так и на CD-ROM играх, и приобрел общую популярность. Платформа значительно потеряла в популярности после выбора Adobe в пользу Macromedia Flash, который очень быстро набирал популярность. В феврале 2019 Adobe объявила о прекращении разработки проигрывателя и прекратила поддержку продукта 2 месяца спустя.",

  "Platforms_Ambulant_Description": "Ambulant - это плеер для файлов SMIL, созданный множеством людей, координирующих работу в CWI в Амстердаме, Нидерланды. Название, по-видимому, связано с \"ambulation\", другим словом, означающим ходьбу; это подтверждается логотипом, изображающим идущего человека. SMIL был спецификацией, разработанной W3C, международным веб-консорциумом, но не завоевал большой популярности. Ambulant попытался стать плеером с открытым исходным кодом, поддерживающим все файлы SMIL. Однако желание сделать все части открытым исходным кодом не позволило им поддерживать некоторые проприетарные медиаформаты. Разработка началась в апреле 2003 года, и первая версия, \"AMBULANT/G\", была выпущена в июле того же года. Последняя стабильная версия, 2.6, была выпущена в феврале 2015 года, однако работа над нестабильной сборкой Ambulant 2.7 продолжалась до июля 2016 года, когда был сделан последний коммит в их репозитории на GitHub.

  "Platforms_HTML_HTML5_Description": "{H}yper{T}ext {M}arkup {L}anguage is a standard for the displaying of documents through a web browser. Originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee throughout the early 1990s (with roots going as far back as 1980,) HTML became the premier method of sharing information through the Internet, its capabilities being expanded upon by other languages such as CSS and JavaScript. It first launched in 1993, and received subsequent updates with HTML2 in 1995, and both HTML3 and HTML4 in 1997. The last update to HTML4 was in 2000, and in the years after its conjoined languages were largely ignored as a platform for games, animations and other web content, with developers opting for plugin-based technology instead, but as technology and the internet evolved, plugins started becoming outdated, so an effort was made to update the standard, and in 2008 HTML5 was launched. As Flash and other plugins fell out of style, HTML5 became the recommended standard, many have shifted their projects to the HTML family - or abandoned proprietary plugins altogether - instead uploading their content to websites such as YouTube. {Note: For brevity reasons, Flashpoint labels any entry that doesn't contain frameworks or plugin-enabled content as \"HTML\".}",

It was an alternative to the Hyperlinks of the World Wide Web, making use of Hyper-G enabled Browsers, which could display 3D models of directories and files, as well as other models, with a built-in viewer. Due to it being based on the increasingly obsolete Gopher, the predecessor to the WWW, it later evolved into Hyperwave in 1996, without the extra capabilities Hyper-G browsers offered, such as the 3D functions. The vast majority of its content is now lost due to how the files were stored with Gopher.",

  "Platforms_Superscape_Viscape_Description": "Launched in 1996 by early 3D pioneer Superscape with support from Intel, and originally called VisNet, Viscape was a 3D plugin that had the distinct advantage of interactivity with worlds, unlike the static models of VRML 1.0. It enjoyed a brief period of popularity, and at first there were no plans to support VRML, but with VRML97 implementing interactivity, an update named Viscape Universal was released in 1998, adding VRML support to remain relevant. This proved to not be enough, with financial trouble and failed partnerships, and reviewers calling the plugin dated and cumbersome despite their efforts at a revival. Although the last update was released in 2000, its tech continued to be utilized in Superscape's Lego Creator series for the following year. An attempt was made to update it by embedding the plugin inside Java Applets, called Vislite, but in the end the company then refocused on mobile game development and achieved moderate success before being purchased by Glu Mobile in 2008.",

  "Platforms_Tcl_Plugin_Description": "Developed by a small team and launched in 1988, Tool Command Language (Tcl, pronounced “tickle”) is an open source dynamic programming language. In 1994, Sun Microsystems brought the team in to develop the tech further. One of the outcomes of this venture was a 1996 plugin that could run Tcl applets (“Tclets”) embedded in pages. In late 1997, Tcl’s development was spun off to an independent company called Scriptics, and spun off once again into Tcl Core Team in 2000. While development of the language remains lively to this day, work on the plugin has slowed to a crawl despite not being officially discontinued. The latest version, 3.1.0, was released in 2006.",
  "Platforms_ThingViewer_Description": "ThingViewer was a 1997 multimedia plugin made by Parable Corporation, who later changed names to ThingWorld in 1998. It made “Things”, assets that could optionally be protected against stealing or tampering and have a unique ID with credit to share around websites, using simple modular programming, to create things such as images, animations and even interactive games, made using the ThingMaker authoring program or converting Shockwave Director files using ThingConverter. It was relatively popular, even getting deals with Microsoft in and several others in 1999, but at the end of 2000, the company reduced staff and was in talks with an unknown party for a merger to sell the tech. The website shut down in 2002.",
  "Platforms_Unity_Web_Player_Description": "Unity Engine - это кроссплатформенный игровой движок, который направлен на более доступную разработку для широких масс, является самым популярным программным обеспечением для разработки игр среди разработчиков во всем мире. Созданный вместе с Unity и вшитый в первом патче в 2005 году, Unity Web Player был инструментом для запуска игр на Unity в браузере. Платформа оставалась популярной для веб 3D-игр, но со снятием поддержки NPAPI в 2016 году, плагин был брошен в пользу Unity WebGL.",
  "Platforms_Visual_WebMap_Description": "Visual WebMap - это инструмент для визуализации интерактивных карт, встроенных в веб-страницу. Он был совместим с несколькими файлами карт из разных программ авторов, мог отображать подробную информацию о секторах и позволяет проводить измерения. После ее выхода в 1997 году никаких изменений не происходило, вплоть до 2004 года, когда страница была закрыта.",
  "Platforms_Vitalize_Description": "Created in 1997 by Corel for displaying content made with their Click&Create multimedia authoring program, Vitalize! was a low bandwidth plugin dedicated to simple web games with an emphasis on gaming, marketing and advertising. Distributed with the help of Europress, it took pride in being “easy to learn and use unlike Java or Shockwave.” Sometime in 1999 the former Corel employees left to create Clickteam, which then took over development in 2000 with version 2.0. The latest version 4.0 was released in 2007/2008, and was available on their website until 2012.",
  "Platforms_VRML_Description": "{V}irtual {R}eality {M}odeling {L}anguage is an open 3D standard and the very first created for the web. When it was initially specified in November 1994, the format could only represent static models with no interactivity. This problem was solved in 1997 when version 2.0, better known as VRML97, was published. Despite never seeing mainstream use, it would become the most popular option for internet-based 3D upon its launch before being superseded in 2001 by X3D (which was backwards compatible with VRML worlds). As it was a file format and not a plugin in itself, many different implementations have been made of VRML, often adding their own non-standard features.",

  "Platforms_Xara_Plugin_Description": "The Xara Plugin was a vector graphics viewer, using a proprietary low bandwidth format. It launched a beta and later full release in 1996, being able to view Flare files made with CORELXara on the web. Later in 1997 Xara Webster was launched to specifically make the web graphics for the plugin. In 1999, 2.08a was the last version released. In 2000, Xara Webster was replaced by XaraX which could export to Flash, another vector plugin, so support for their own proprietary option was dropped, and it was relegated to the legacy software archive.",
