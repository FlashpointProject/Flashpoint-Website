  "Discord_Rule1": "請遵守 Discord 及我們的使用規範：{https://discordapp.com/terms} / {https://discordapp.com/guidelines}。",
  "Discord_Rule2": "對他人保持尊重。請不要過於固執、挑起紛爭、做出粗魯無禮的行為、反覆提及使用者或身分組，或在未經允許的情況下對伺服器成員 (包含管理者) 發送私人訊息。",

  "Discord_Rule4": "Distribution of content that is currently being sold or requested to be removed from Flashpoint is not allowed.",
  "Discord_Rule5": "{Never send emails relating to Flashpoint without the consent of staff, no matter how good you think it is.} Nobody wants their chance of contacting a developer to go to waste, that's why we want to make sure it doesn't happen.",

  "Discord_Rule7": "NSFW content and discussion must be kept in {#nsfw-lounge} (the channel's existence alone should explain more than enough).",
