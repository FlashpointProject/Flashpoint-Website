  "About_Title": "Flashpoint Archive is a community effort to preserve games and animations from the web.",
  "About_Para1": "Internet history and culture is important, and the web is evolving at such a rapid pace that what might be commonplace today could be obsolete tomorrow. This project is dedicated to preserving as many experiences from these platforms as possible, so that they aren't lost to time. Since December 2017, {over {} games and animations} have been preserved across more than a hundred browser plugins and web technologies.",
  "About_Para2": "In addition to our preservation efforts, we also provide a highly flexible software package for reliable navigation and playback of preserved content. Among the software that powers Flashpoint is {a fully-featured launcher} that acts as a frontend for the collection, {a proxy} that tricks games into thinking they're running on the live web, and {a sandbox} that allows for secure playback of plugin-enabled content - all of which are {open-source software}.",
  "About_Para3": "本計畫 {was originally started} 原先由 BlueMaxima 發起，目標是在 Flash 終止支援前拯救即將消失的網頁遊戲。從此開始，這項計畫逐漸進化為一項大規模行動，現在有來自全球數百個社群的貢獻者參與其中，致力於保存使用網頁附加元件、架構及標準所製作的遊戲及動畫。",
  "About_Para4": "Flashpoint Archive operates as non-profit with the goal of furthering efforts in the preservation and accessibility of games, animations and other digital interactive experiences from the web.
